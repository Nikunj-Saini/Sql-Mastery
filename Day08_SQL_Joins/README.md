# Day 8: SQL Joins

## Overview
On Day 8, I learned about SQL joins in MySQL. Joins are used to combine data from multiple tables to extract meaningful insights.

## Topics Covered
- **Basic Joins:** INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN (using UNION)
- **Advanced Joins:** LEFT ANTI JOIN, RIGHT ANTI JOIN, CROSS JOIN
- **Multiple Table Joins:** Joining 4 tables (Orders, Customers, Products, Employees)

## Key Takeaways
- INNER JOIN returns only matching records.
- LEFT JOIN returns all records from the left table, with NULLs for missing matches.
- RIGHT JOIN returns all records from the right table.
- FULL OUTER JOIN is not directly supported in MySQL; use UNION of LEFT and RIGHT joins.
- Anti joins help find unmatched records.
- CROSS JOIN returns all combinations of two tables.
